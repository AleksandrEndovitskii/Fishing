# Fishing

Note: Please select one or more of the following tasks to demonstrate your expertise and skills. While we value a polished end product, the emphasis here is on your problem-solving approach, coding style, and understanding of the concepts. Each task should not take more than a couple of hours to complete. Once done, please provide a brief explanation of your approach, any assets used, and the final product.

Task 1 - Basic Fishing Mechanic:
Create a simple 2D fishing game scene in Unity where the player can cast a line into a pond.
Include at least 3 fish that move randomly in the pond.
Allow the player to reel in a fish when it gets near the fishing line.
Proficiency: Understanding of basic Unity physics, 2D animations, and user input.

Task 2 - Implementing a Simple RTP Mechanic:
Building upon Task 1 or from scratch, implement a Return To Player (RTP) mechanic.
For every 10 attempts (casts), ensure that at least 3 attempts result in catching a fish, demonstrating a 30% RTP.
Display a counter for the player's successful catches and total attempts.
Proficiency: Understanding of Task 1, basic game mechanics, and the concept of RTP.

Task 3 - Basic Multiplayer Interaction with Dedicated Server:
Set up a simple dedicated server (local or cloud-based, based on your preference).
Allow two players to join the game from different devices or browser windows.
Display both players' fishing lines and catches in real-time to each participant.
Proficiency: Understanding of network programming, server-client interactions, and basic multiplayer game mechanics.

Task 4 - Implementing a Simple RNG and Volatility Mechanic:
Building upon Task 2 or from scratch, add a mechanic where different fish have varying difficulties to catch, representing volatility.
Implement a simple RNG system that determines which fish bites the line, with rarer fish having a lower chance.
Display a log that showcases the result of the last 10 fishing attempts (e.g., "Common Fish," "Rare Fish," "Missed").
Proficiency: Understanding of Task 2, RNG principles, and the concept of game volatility.

Note: For all tasks, applicants are free to use any available assets or tools. The focus is on functionality and understanding of the concepts rather than aesthetic polish. Once a task is chosen and completed, please submit the project files, any necessary documentation or instructions, and a brief write-up of your approach.
